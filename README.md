# Internship at AXA

Here you can find all the external and accessible codes I made during my two-months internship at AXA.

After my first year of Bachelor at Albert School, I did an internship in the R&D team of AXA Group Operations. 
I was able to code mainly in python, to help my internship supervisor with his datamodel. We worked on the carbon emissions of different scenarios. 

My supervisor has developed a data model, available <a href="https://github.com/borisruf/carbon-footprint-modeling-tool/tree/main">here </a>, which compares different carbon emissions with each other, or with everyday actions. This makes carbon balance issues more accessible to the average human. 
So we're formalizing the scenarios in the same json file format, so that we can compare them together.

All the code is available on its datamodel, but you'll find in this repository codes to collect the data.
In fact, I've improved the datamodel by adding new scenarios. To do this, I've collected external data, notably with selenium.

So here's some of the code I've done during this internship (the main part is on Boris Ruf's repository, called "Carbon Footprint Modeling Tool")
